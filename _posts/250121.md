## 1. Readability
Code readability is all about how easily developers can understand what the code does. This matters because sooner or later, developers will need to maintain, debug, or refactor that code. Here are three ways that help improve code readability: reduce context, name things well, and make it read from top to bottom.

## 2. Predictability
When we read the code, we keep predicting what the code dose. If the code does what we expect, we feel comfortable. If not, we feel confused. 

## 3. Cohesion
Cohesion is about how well the code is organized. If the code is well-organized, it's easier to understand. If not, it's harder to understand.
> **Readability and cohesion can sometimes conflict with each other.** For example, the well-organized code might not be readable. So, you need to find a balance between them.
