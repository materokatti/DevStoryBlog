I recently completed the migration of our admin page from React to Retool. Retool is a SaaS tool that makes building admin panels much easier. As a software engineer, using SaaS services often makes me uncomfortable. It sometimes feels like I'm giving up my engineering craftsmanship. But the migration to Retool has given me so many benefits. Now I can focus more on our mobile app service than before. And instead of wrestling with seemingly meaningless UI elements, I can spend my time with optimizing queries and APIs that power our Admin interface. ***Getting help from technology to focus on more impactful work turned out better than I expected.***
